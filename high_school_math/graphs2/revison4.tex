\begin{enumerate}

\item The graph of $y=f(x)$ undergoes in succession, the following three transformations

\begin{enumerate}
\item A translation of 1 unit in the negative $x$ direction
\item A reflection about the $y$ axis
\item A stretch parallel to the $x$ axis (with the $y$ axis invariant) with a scale factor of $2$
\end{enumerate}

The equation of the resulting curve is $y=g(x)$ where $g(x) = \cfrac{x^2 - 2x - 3}{x + 2}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Express $f(x)$ in the form $g(ax+b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants to be found.
\item Sketch the graph of $y=g(x)$, show clearly all the intersections with the axes, the asymptotes and the coordinates of turning points (if any).
\end{enumerate}

\item Describe 2 different transformations that will map the graph of $y=5^x$ onto the graph of $y=5^{x+2}$.

\item The graph of $y = 5^{x+2}$ is reflected about the $y$ axis followed by a translation of $-4$ units in the direction of the $y$ axis. Find the equation of the final graph.

\item The curve of $y=x^2 + \cfrac{3}{x}$ undergoes a reflection about the line $y=m$ and the point $(2,5.5)$ is mapped onto $(2,2.5)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item State the value of $m$.
\item Hence find the equation of the new curve.
\end{enumerate}

\item A graph with equation $y=f(x)$ undergoes transformation A followed by transformation B.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A: a translation of 2 units in the negative direction of the $x$ axis
\item B: a scaling parallel to the $x$ axis by a factor of $12$
\end{enumerate}

The resulting equation is $g(x)=8x + 8 + \cfrac{1}{(2x + 1)^2}$. Find the equation $y=f(x)$, showing your workings clearly.

\item The function $y=(q-r)x^2 + (3r - 2)x + 1$ is obtained by transforming the function $y=px^2 + qx + r$ through the following transformations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Translation of -1 units parallel to the $x$ axis
\item Scaling by a factor of 2 parallel to the $y$ axis
\end{enumerate}

Show that $4p + 2q - 3r = 2$. Hence, find the exact values of $p, q$ and $r$ by forming three equations involving $p, q$ and $r$.
\end{enumerate}
