\item In triangle $\Delta ABC$, point $D$ lies on $AC$ and point $E$ lies on $BC$. Angles $ABC$ and $EDC$ are right angles. Given that $CD=6 cm, AD=7 cm$ and $AB=5 cm$, what is the area of $ABED$?

\item Four congruent circles, each of which is tangent externally to two of the other three circles, are circumscribed by a square of area $144 cm^2$. If a small circle is then placed in the centre so that it is tangent to each of the circles, what is the diameter of the small circle?

\item In quadrilateral $PQRS$, side $PQ$ is parallel to and 3 times as long as side $SR$. Diagonals $PR$ and $QS$ intersect at $O, PO:OR = 1:3$ and $QO:OS = 1:4$. If $\Delta PQO$ has area $2 cm^2$, find the area of $PQRS$.

\item $ABCD$ is an isoceles trapezium with $AB$ parallel to $DC$, $AC=DC$ and $AD=BC$. If the height of the trapezium is equal to $AB$, find the ratio of $AB:DC$.

\item In triangle $ABC$, $M$ and $N$ are points on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively such that $AM:MB = 1:3$ and $AN:NC = 3:5$. What is the ratio of $[MNC]:[ABC]$?

\item Six right-angled triangles are assembled together. Given $PQ=a$ and $QR=8a$, find $(b-a)(b+a)$ in terms of $a$.

\item On side $BC$ of $\Delta ABC$ point $A_1$ is taken so that $BA_1 : A_1C = 2 : 1$. What is the ratio in which median $CC_1$ divides segment $AA_1$?

\item Square $PQRS$ is inscribed into $\Delta ABC$ so that vertices $P$ and $Q$ lie on sides $AB$ and $AC$ and vertices $R$ and $S$ lie on $BC$. Express the length of the squareâ€™s side through $a$ and $h_a$.

\itemone Four isoceles right triangles are removed from the four corners of a square piece of paper so that a rectangle remains. What is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle if the sum of the areas of the cut-off pieces is $200 cm^2$?

\itemtwo Congruent radii $PS$ and $QR$ intersect tangent $SR$. If the two disjoint shaded regions have equal area and if $PS=10cm$, what is the area of rectangle $PRQS$?

\itemtwo An equilateral triangle $ABC$ has area $\sqrt 3$ and side length $2$. Point $P$ is an arbitrary point in the interior of the triangle. What is the sum of the distances from $P$ to $AB, AC$ and $BC$?

\section*{Proofs}

\item Consider heights $AA_1$ and $BB_1$ in acute triangle $\Delta ABC$. Prove that $A_1C \cdot BC = B_1C \cdot AC$.

\item Consider height $CH$ in right triangle $ABC$ with right angle $C$. Prove that $AC_2 = AB \cdot AH$ and $CH_2 = AH \cdot BH$.

\itemtwo Prove that the medians of a triangle meet at one point and this point divides each median in the ratio of 2 : 1 counting from the vertex. (A median is a line from a vertex to the opposite side that divides the side equally)
