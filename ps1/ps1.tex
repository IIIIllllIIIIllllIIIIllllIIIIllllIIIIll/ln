A is Dedekind-infinite: $\exists$ $A' \subset A$ such that $A \leftrightarrow A'$


Given $A' \subseteq A$

* Show that $A$ is D-finite $\implies A'$ is D-finite

It suffices to show that $A'$ is D-infinite $\implies A$ is D-infinite

Since $A'$ is D-infinite $\exists A'' \subset A'$ and $A'' \leftrightarrow A'$

Call the bijection between $A'$ and $A''$ $f$

Construct a bijection g such that

$g(x) = f(x)$ when $x \in A'$

$g(x) = x$ otherwise

g bijects $A$ to $(A - A') \cup A'' $

hence $A$ is D-infinite

* Show that the following are equivalent

1) Any injection $A \rightarrow A$ is a surjection

2) A is D-finite

3) There is no injection $i: N \rightarrow A$

First, $\lnot 2 \implies \lnot 1$. Also $\lnot 1 \implies \lnot 2$. 

Proof: By definition

Next, $\lnot 3 \implies \lnot 2$

Let $R(N) \subseteq S$ be the range of i on N. i is now a bijection $N \leftrightarrow R(N)$

Since the given $i$ is an injection, it has an inverse $i^{-1}$

Consider the injection: $x \in R(N) \rightarrow i(2 i^{-1}(x))$

This injects $R(N)$ to $R(2N)$

And because $2N \subset N, R == N, R(2N) \subset R(N)$

Hence $R$ is D-infinite and so is its parent set S.

Lastly, $\lnot 2 \implies \lnot 3$`

Call the bijection $p$

Lemma: if $X$ is D-infinite $p(X)$ is also D-infinite.

Proof: $p(X)$ bijects with $p(X') \subset p(X)$

So $p^n(A)$ is D-infinite for all n

Furthermore $p^n(A) - p^{n+1}(A)$ is nonempty because $p(p^n(A)) \subset p^n(A)$

Then map $n$ to an element in $p^n(A) - p^{n+1}(A)$. Done!

* Show that the union of two D-finite sets is D-finite

$A$ finite and $B$ finite $\implies A \cup B$ D-finite

We'll show $A \cup B$ D-infinite $\implies A$ D-infinite or $B$ D-infinite

There is an injection $i$ from $N \rightarrow A \cup B$

Consider the sets $N_A = i^{-1}(A)$ and $N_B = i^{-1}(B)$.

$N_A \cup N_B = N$

We will show that one of them must be bounded.

If $N_A$ is bounded by $m_A$ and $N_B$ is bounded by $m_B$, $N$ is bounded by $\max(m_A, m_B)$. Clearly wrong.

So $S$, which is $A$ or $B$, is unbounded.

Consider the injection $j$ defined by $0 \rightarrow$ smallest element of $S$

And $n \rightarrow$ smallest element of $S$ larger than $j(n-1)$; this exists because S is unbounded

Hence $N \rightarrow S$, so S is infinite.
