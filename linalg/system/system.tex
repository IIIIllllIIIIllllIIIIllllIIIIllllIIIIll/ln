\section{System of linear equations}

1.4 Theorem (Gaussâ€™ method) If a linear system is changed to another by
one of these operations
(1) an equation is swapped with another
(2) an equation has both sides multiplied by a nonzero constant
(3) an equation is replaced by the sum of itself and a multiple of another
then the two systems have the same set of solutions.
