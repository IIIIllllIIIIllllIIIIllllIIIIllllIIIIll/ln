\section{Vector space}

I assume you know enough about $\mathbb{R}^n$. $R^n$ satisfies some axioms, which we can identify and thus generalize.

We can add any two vectors, and we can multiply vectors by scalars.

\subsection*{Group poperties}

Pretty much boring stuff.\\\\
Closure\\
Associativity of addition\\
Additive Identity\\
Inverse\\
Commutativity

\subsection*{Scalars}

Getting interesting.\\\\
Multplicative Identity\\
Associativity of multiplication\\
Distributivity 
(r+s)X=rX+sX. 	
r(X+Y)=rX+rY. 	

\section{Vector subspace}

A vector subspace is a subset of a vector space that is also a vector space.
