\title{Symmetric group and determinants}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

This document will bring together two subjects.

\section{Symmetric group}

We studied this in group theory, where we talked about the sign of a permutation, etc. By representing elements of $S_n$ as matrices, we can apply linear algebra to it and prove things more easily.

\section{Determinant}

When we physically motivated the determinant, there was an interesting axiom that had seemingly no physical basis: interchange of rows flips the sign of $\det A$. Of course in that case the volume is given by $| \det A |$. Here we will see why the determinant has a sign and also explain the formulas for calculating determinant (complete expansion and expansion by minors) in terms of permutations.
